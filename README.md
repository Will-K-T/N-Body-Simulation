# N Body Simulation
This is a colorful interpretation of the n-body simulation. An n-body simulation is a simulation of a dynamical system of particles, usually under the influence of physical forces; my implementation is focused on planets and how they pull on each other to create complex orbits. I used Newtonâ€™s equation of gravity to calculate the force that each body applies to each other. I also created and used my own vector class to store the force, acceleration, velocity, and position of each body in space. The use of vectors makes updating the positions of the bodies quite straightforward.

In the images above, the solar system can be seen approaching a fictional body of very high mass (black hole). The distances, masses, sizes, and number of bodies (except for the black hole) are consistent with the actual solar system! The first image shows the orbits starting to warp down towards the black hole. The second image shows what happens after the bodies have reached the black hole.

In this image, the first four planets, also known as the terrestrial planets, can be seen orbiting the sun. Once again, everything is to the proper scale as it is in the real solar system!
